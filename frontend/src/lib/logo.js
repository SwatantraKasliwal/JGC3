/* The exporter's own pictures — the mark, the printed address block, and the
   signature and stamp the client puts at the foot of a signed letter.

   The supplier purchase order is printed on Jaikvin's own letterhead, so the
   mark has to travel inside the .xlsx rather than be linked to it. The packing
   declaration (21, 33) needs the address block as well: its own file sets that
   block as a floating text box, five lines in three inks and a letter-spaced
   name, and the truest way to put that on a worksheet is the block itself.

   Both files are in public/, and the workbook writer wants the bytes, so each
   is fetched once and kept — the fetch starts as soon as the document engine
   loads, long before anyone clicks a download. Should either fail (offline,
   blocked), the document simply prints without it, which is what it did
   before.

   The previews want the same two pictures as an <img>, and cannot have them as
   a path: what a preview renders is passed through lib/safeHtml.js, which
   allows an image only if its src is a data: URI — a rule that exists so a
   document can never be made to fetch anything off another host. So the bytes
   already in hand are handed to the page as data: URIs. Point an <img> at
   "/logo.png" instead and the sanitiser drops the src, which is a letterhead
   that silently prints blank on screen while the .xlsx carries it fine. */
